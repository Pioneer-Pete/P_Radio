P_Radio was created as a homage to the iconic radios seen in the Portal video game series, to be distributed around UW-Platteville on April 1st, 2025.
The project's goal was to create an accurate representation of the Portal radios, both in appearance and sound, while retaining a sub-dollar cost per unit to enable a large number of units to be created and distributed.
Excluding the 3D printing costs, each unit meets the original goal, coming in at exactly $1. Filament costs ended up being approximately $0.40 per unit.

## Project Information

 3D Models: The base and shell were modeled in Fusion 360. STEP, STL, and F3D files are included.
 
 PCB Design: A custom PCB was designed using KiCAD, and four expansion ports were included for any future tinkerers out there.
 
 Code: The radio is powered by an STM8S003F3, a cost-effective 8-bit microcontroller. This necessitated using STM's STVD and STVP to program the boards. If remaking the project, I would look into using the STM Arduino library instead.

 Assembly: Everything snaps together without any hardware; the hole at the top of the shell accepts a ~4-inch length of standard 1.75mm filament to act as the antenna. The batteries require a small strip of aluminum foil to complete the circuit at the end opposite the PCB. The calculated battery lifespan is 1-2 months, but it has yet to be tested.
